# Course Code: CS704

# Mini Project

## Overview
Many organizations are unenthusiastic to use cloud services due to data security issues as the data resides on the cloud services provider’s servers. To address this issue, there have been several approaches applied by various researchers worldwide to strengthen security of the stored data on cloud computing.The Bi-directional DNA Encryption Algorithm (BDEA)[1] is one such data security techniques. This repository provides the implementation of Bi-directional DNA Encryption Algorithm (BDEA).
